# Reflection

### ❓ What patterns or surprises did you notice?

I noticed a pattern of consistently staging and committing changes whenever a new function was implemented. This is a good habit, as it allows you to track the introduction of new code. If something goes wrong, you'll know when it happened and where to start looking.

### 🧠 What logic challenged your thinking?

The idea that this "toolkit" will eventually grow to include more complex code and reusable functions challenges me to think ahead. It pushes me to write functions in a way that makes them extensible for future development. I'll need to consider what features I might want to add later and design the functions with that in mind.

### 🌍 How might this kind of toolkit be used in the real world?

This toolkit would definitely come in handy anytime you need to use common math-related functions. It’s helpful because you wouldn’t have to rewrite code—you could just pull what you need from the toolkit. You might need to tweak a function to fit a specific project or use case, but that’s still way easier than starting from scratch.
